				<h1>Programming languages and their Uses</h1>

				<p>The landscape of programming languages is rich and expanding, which can make it tricky to focus on
					just one or another for your career. We highlight some of the most popular languages that are
					modern, widely used, and come with loads of packages or libraries that will help you be more
					productive and efficient in your work.</p>

				<p>"The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it."<br> —Dennis Ritchie
				</p>
				<p>The world has been evolving at an astonishing rate, and a solid part of the credit for that
					advancement goes to the application developers. In case you haven’t noticed, application development
					has become all the rage in recent years.

				<p>Everyone is trying to get in on the application development scene as it offers some of the
					highest-payingṣ career paths, such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and
					more.But before you start on a career path and create your first application, you need to first pick
					a programming language. And boy, there are a lot of programming languages, more than 700 actually,
					to choose from.</p>

				<p>Seems like a crazy high number, right? </p>

				<p>Don’t worry. We’ve compiled this list to make this choice as smooth as possible for you by going over
					some popular programming languages and their common uses.If you’re planning to pick up a programming
					language in 2021, we’d suggest picking up something that is more modern, widely used, and has loads
					of packages or libraries.In this section, we’ll go over some of the widely used programming
					languages that tick all the boxes that we mentioned above and share their uses as well.</p>

				<h2>1. Python—Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</h2>
				<! <h5>Python notes, April 25-04-2023</h5> 

				<img src="IMG/python.png">
				<p>Developed by Guido van Rossum in the 1990s, the multi-purpose high-level Python has grown
					extremely fast over the years to become one of the most popular programming languages today.And
					the number one reason for Python’s popularity is its beginner-friendliness, which allows anyone,
					even individuals with no programming background, to pick up Python and start creating simple
					programs.</p>

				<h5>javaScript notes, April 25-04-2023</h5>

				<img src="IMG/javascript.jpg">
				<p>JavaScript was one of the key programming languages alongside HTML and CSS that helped build the
					internet. JavaScript was created in 1995 by Netscape, the company that released the famous
					Netscape Navigator browser, to eliminate the crudeness of static web pages and add a pinch of
					dynamic behavior to them.</p>

				<h5>R notes, April 25-04-2023</h5>

				<img src="IMG/R.jpg">
				<p>If you do any sort of data analysis or work on Machine Learning projects, the chances are that
					you may have heard about R. The R programming language was first released to the public in 1993
					by its creators Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman as an implementation of the S programming
					language with a special focus on statistical computing and graphical modeling.</p>

				<h2>5. C/C++—Operating Systems and System Tools</h2>
				<h5>C/C++ notes, April 25-04-2023</h5>

				<img src="IMG/C-img.jpg">
				<p>Believe it or not, the programming languages C/C++ were all the rage in the very late 20th
					century. Why?It’s because C and C++ are both very low-level programming languages, offering
					blazing fast performance, which is why they were and are still being used to develop operating
					systems, file systems, and other system-level applications.</p>
