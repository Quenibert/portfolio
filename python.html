					<ul>
						<li>Level: Beginner</li>
						<li>Popular Frameworks: Django, Flask</li>

					</ul>
					<p>Developed by Guido van Rossum in the 1990s, the multi-purpose high-level Python has grown extremely fast over the years to become one of the most popular programming languages today.And the number one reason for Python’s popularity is its beginner-friendliness, which allows anyone, even individuals with no programming background, to pick up Python and start creating simple programs.</p>
					<p>But that’s not all. It also offers an exceptionally vast collection of packages and libraries that can play a key role in reducing the ETA for your projects, along with a strong community of like-minded developers that is eager to help.</p>
					<h2>What this language is used for—</h2>
					<p>Although Python can be used to build pretty much anything, it really shines when it comes to working on technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Analytics. Python also proves to be useful for web development, creating enterprise applications, and GUIs for applications.</p>
