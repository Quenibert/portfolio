					<p>f you do any sort of data analysis or work on Machine Learning projects, the chances are that you may have heard about R. The R programming language was first released to the public in 1993 by its creators Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman as an implementation of the S programming language with a special focus on statistical computing and graphical modeling.</p>
					<p>Over the years, R became one of the best programming languages for projects requiring extensive data analysis, graphical data modeling, spatial and time-series analysis.</p>
					<p>R also provides great extensibility via its functions and extensions that offer a ton of specialized techniques and capabilities to developers. The language also works remarkably well with code from other programming languages, such as C, C++, Python, Java, and .NET.</p>
					<h2>What this language is used for-</h2>
					<p>Apart from some of the uses mentioned above, R can be used for behavior analysis, data science, and machine learning projects that involve classification, clustering, and more.</p>
