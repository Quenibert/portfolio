					<p>JavaScript was one of the key programming languages alongside HTML and CSS that helped build the internet. JavaScript was created in 1995 by Netscape, the company that released the famous Netscape Navigator browser, to eliminate the crudeness of static web pages and add a pinch of dynamic behavior to them.</p>
					<p>Today, JavaScript has become a high-level multi-paradigm programming language that serves as the world’s top frontend programming language for the web, handling all the interactions offered by the webpages, such as pop-ups, alerts, events, and many more like them.</p>
